### We pointed null values in 'book_author' and 'publisher' feature.

### Let's look at the unique years to realize the time period as this dataset was created in 2004.
# getting unique value from 'year_of_publication' feature
book_data['year_of_publication'].unique()
###  Let's check at the corresponding rows in the dataframe.

df = pd.DataFrame(book_data)
cols = [4]
df = df[df.columns[cols]]

# Let's see now user_data dataset

print(users_data.shape)
# unique value in age
users_data['age'].unique()
### There is NaN value in age. We can replace NaN with mean of 'age'.
# replacing nan with average of 'age'
users_data['age'].fillna((users_data['age'].mean()), inplace=True)
users_data['age'].unique()
# retrieving age data between 5 to 90

#### As we can see above we don't have any null values for age.
# Now let's take ratings_data dataset

# Data Visualizations
## Book_data dataset 
#### Question 1 
##### Which are the top Author with number of books ?
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.countplot(y="book_author",palette = 'Paired', data=book_data,order=book_data['book_author'].value_counts().index[0:20])
plt.title("Top 20 author with number of books")
### Agatha Christie is leading at top with more than 600 counts, followed by William Shakespeare. We can plot some hypothesis point :-

It can happen in some possible cases that Agatha Christie is not a best Author, though Agatha Christie has most number of books as compared to others.

William Shakespeare is one of the popular Author in the world. Still he doesn't have highest number of books.

Among all other Authors, it might happen that few of the Author might have some of the best seller books who have millions of copies been sold in world.
#### Question 2 
#### Which are top publishers with published books ?
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.countplot(y="publisher",palette = 'Paired', data=book_data,order=book_data['publisher'].value_counts().index[0:20])
plt.title("Top 20 Publishers with number of books published")
# Harlequin has most number of books published, followed by Silhouette. Hypothesis analysis to focus :-

Some of the top Author's had published their books from Harlequin.

We can observe Harlequin publiser's marking better performance than any other publishers.

Penguin Books, Warner Books, Penguin USA, Berkely Publishing Group and many more are among popular publisher's remarking competition with Harlequin.

Though Penguin Books Publisher has less number of books published but it might happen that only top Author's are approaching towards Penguin Books Publisher.
## Question 3 
### Number of Books published in yearly. 
publications = {}
for year in book_data['year_of_publication']:
    if str(year) not in publications:
        publications[str(year)] = 0
    publications[str(year)] +=1

publications = {k:v for k, v in sorted(publications.items())}

fig = plt.figure(figsize =(55, 15))
plt.bar(list(publications.keys()),list(publications.values()), color = 'blue')
plt.ylabel("Number of books published")
plt.xlabel("Year of Publication")
plt.title("Number of books published yearly")
plt.margins(x = 0)
plt.show()
book_data.year_of_publication = pd.to_numeric(book_data.year_of_publication, errors='coerce')

# Checking for 0's or NaNs in Year of Publication
zero_year = book_data[book_data.year_of_publication == 0].year_of_publication.count()
nan_year = book_data.year_of_publication.isnull().sum()

print(f'There are {zero_year} entries as \'0\', and {nan_year} NaN entries in the Year of Publication field')

# Replace all years of zero with NaN
book_data.year_of_publication.replace(0, np.nan, inplace=True)
year = book_data.year_of_publication.value_counts().sort_index()
year = year.where(year>5) 
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 15}) 
plt.bar(year.index, year.values)
plt.xlabel('Year of Publication')
plt.ylabel('counts')
plt.show()
## So we can see publication years are somewhat between 1950 - 2005 here.The publication of books got vital when it starts emerging from 1950. We can get some hyothesis key points:-

It might happen people starts to understand the importance of books and gradually got productivity habits in their life.

Every user has their own taste to read books based on what particular subject Author uses. The subject of writing books got emerge from late 1940 slowly. Till 1970 it has got the opportunity to recommend books to people or users what they love to read.

The highest peak we can observe is between 1995-2001 year. The user understand what they like to read. Looking towards the raise the recommendation is also increase to understand their interest. 
# User_data Dataset
### Question 4 
Age distributions of users_data
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
users_data.age.hist(bins=[10*i for i in range(1, 10)], color = 'cyan')     
plt.title('Age Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
### Looking towards the users age between 30-40 prefer more and somewhat we can also view between 20-30. Let's make some hypothesis analysis:-

It is obvious that most of the user books are from Age 30 to 40.

It might happen that the users are more interested on that subject what Authors are publishing in the market.

The age group between 20-30 are immensely attracted to read books published by Author.

We can observe same pitch for Age group between 10-20 and 50-60. There are can be lot of different reasons. 
# Ratings_data Dataset
### Analysis No. 5

#### What are top 20 books as per number of ratings ? 
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.countplot(y="book_title",palette = 'Paired',data= book_data, order=book_data['book_title'].value_counts().index[0:15])
plt.title("Top 20 books as per number of ratings")
As per ratings "Selected Poems" has been rated most followed by "Little Women".
Selected Poems are most favourable to users as per ratings.

Three of the books 'The Secret Garden', 'Dracula','Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'are struggling to compete with each other.

Similarly, we can observe in 'Masquerade','Black Beauty','Frankenstein'.


plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.countplot(x="book_rating",palette = 'Paired',data= unique_ratings)
### Firstly the above ratings are unique ratings from 'ratings_data' and 'books_data' dataset. We have to separate the explicit ratings represented by 1–10 and implicit ratings represented by 0. Let's make some hypothesis assumptions :-

This countplot shows users have rated 0 the most, which means they haven't rated books at all.

Still we can see pattern to recognize in ratings from 1-10.

Mostly the users have rated 8 ratings out of 10 as per books. It might happen that the feedback is positive but not extremely positive as 10 ratings (i.e best books ever). 
ratings.head(2)
ratings_new = ratings[ratings.isbn.isin(book_data.isbn)]
ratings.shape,ratings_new.shape
Ratings dataset should have ratings from users which exist in users dataset.
print("Shape of dataset before dropping",ratings_new.shape)
ratings_new = ratings_new[ratings_new['user_id'].isin(users_data['user_id'])]
print("shape of dataset after dropping",ratings_new.shape)
It can be seen that no new user was there in ratings dataset.¶
# Let's see how the ratings are distributed
plt.rc("font", size=15)
ratings_new['book_rating'].value_counts(sort=False).plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Rating Distribution\n')
plt.xlabel('Rating')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
#Hence segragating implicit and explict ratings datasets
ratings_explicit = ratings_new[ratings_new['book_rating'] != 0]
ratings_implicit = ratings_new[ratings_new['book_rating'] == 0]
print('ratings_explicit dataset shape',ratings_explicit.shape)
print('ratings_implicit dataset',ratings_implicit.shape)
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(data=ratings_explicit , x='book_rating',palette = 'Paired')
It can be observe that higher ratings are more common amongst users and rating 8 has been rated highest number of times
Let's find the top 5 books which are rated by most number of users.
rating_count = pd.DataFrame(ratings_explicit.groupby('isbn')['book_rating'].count())
rating_count.sort_values('book_rating', ascending=False).head()
most_rated_books = pd.DataFrame(['0316666343', '0971880107', '0385504209', '0312195516', '0060928336'], index=np.arange(5), columns = ['isbn'])
